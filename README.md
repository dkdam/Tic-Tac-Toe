# Project Zero : TicTacToe


## Introduction

This is one of my first **Project** from GA (General Assembly). The first project of the course was to create a simple _Tic Tac Toe_ game. It's a simple game that require us to use the skill that we have learnt in the last 2-3 weeks since the beginning of our course. 

This game have the following rules:

1. This game is played with 3x3 square grid.
2. Your player **X** and the the other player is **O**.
3. You start first by clicking on any part of the board and takes turns in between.
4. First player to get 3 in a row (rows, columns or diagonal) **WINS!** 
5. But if you both fill all 9 spots of the grid then it's a **Tie**.

And then press the **Reset Button** to play again.
